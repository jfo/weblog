        <div><p>A few weeks ago I visited some old friends in DC. I splurged a little and took
the train- it was too expensive; I waited too long to buy the tickets, but it
was also totally worth it.</p>
<p>I used to take the mega/bolt/fungwah bus to DC pretty frequently, or to
Philadelphia, or Baltimore, wait did I ever go to Baltimore? Maybe not; I went
to Boston though, to do stupid event photography gigs for a now defunct <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/sheckys-new-york-4">weird
event company</a>, I think the owner
fled the country; they still owe me 150 dollars.</p>
<p>Anyway here I was, taking the train, like an <em>adult</em> or something. And we came
back into the station, <em>the</em> station, Penn Station, and I&#39;m walking through the
stink (I always say it&#39;s like crawling into the city through its own asshole)
and I&#39;m waiting on my train, the C train, the <em>oldest, shittiest line</em> in
the whole system, the cars being mostly from the 1950&#39;s and thus dramatically
older than I am, corporeally speaking, and the A trains are going by first one
and then three A trains and then <em>five</em>? How can there be a 5:1 ratio?</p>
<p>And the <em>entire time</em> I am waiting for this rickety local train, the better
part of an hour, there are these two rats on the tracks, and they are just
really <em>fighting</em> each other, really going after it, you know? Like some real
feral lord of the rats type biting, and tackling... and I thought, is there a
better metaphor for New York City? Than two rats, fighting in the muck on the
subway tracks, forever and ever?</p>
<hr>

<p>Anyway, I&#39;m moving to Denmark. My wife is Danish, and we&#39;re having a baby, and
so I&#39;m moving. I&#39;ll be looking for work in technology in Copenhagen. I want a
place small enough that I can have a big impact on it, but big enough to offer
some measure of stability<sup>1</sup>. I&#39;m going to buy a nice bike on my first
day, and when I bike around the city nobody is going to try to run me off the
road like they do in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> As a former professional musician, my idea of &quot;stability&quot; is
probably way, way less stable than yours for most values of $you. What I
really mean here is &quot;Can be expected to offer 2-3 years of not super tumultuous
work security&quot;</p>
