<p>You know, I&#39;ve always really loved chess. I&#39;ve never taken it particularly
seriously, but ever since high school I&#39;ve always had a friend or two around
who is interested enough in it to play a few actual sit down, drag out, sweaty
brow games with. I used to get walloped on yahoo chess too. I would think to
myself &quot;I&#39;m pretty good so why am I getting beat so bad all the time?&quot;</p>
<p>Reader, I was not really good.</p>
<p>By chess standards I was (and am, but we&#39;ll come back to that in a bit) truly bad.</p>
<p>First there was yahoo chess, then there was chess.com, and finally lichess,
appealing as it does to my open source bones. I&#39;ve been mediocre to bad on all
of them at one point or another. Maybe a couple of times a year I&#39;ll go on a
little kick, play a hundres or so blitz games, and if I&#39;m lucky my rating will
end a bit higher than it started that time around. Usually though, it might
fluctuate a bit, maybe even go up some, only to crash tragically back down into
the triple digits while I curse my own name in disgust and give up again until the next merry-go-round.</p>
<p>It was just some such downswing I was on a few weeks ago when I played a fateful game.</p>

<p>I had just put my 3 year old to bed, he insists that I stay in the hallway for
a few minutes while he dozes off. This is fine, it&#39;s even a moment of enforced
silence and peace for me, and it&#39;s an excellent time to get a good 3 min blitz
game in. So I&#39;m playing this game, half paying attention as I often did,
keeping an ear out in case my kid needs me for something, and I&#39;m really
shitting the bed here, I mean it&#39;s bad. Dropping pieces like a real n00b,
missing easy tactical wins, just a normal sub-par performance I had come to
expect from myself. Then, it happens. My opponent, no doubt a true gentleman from jolly old england, chats me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you suck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, this isn&#39;t the first time someone on an internet chess site has trash
chatted me. Someone once threatened to kill my family after a rare checkmate!
But something just snapped in me with this one. I started paying attention, and
I crushed him. I was shaking, I was so mad.</p>
<p>After I forwent an easy checkmate to further humiliate him and ended up pawn
forking his king and queen, I had my chance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you suck</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said.</p>
<p>And that was that, that was the last rated game I played for the year on
chess.com. I resolved at that moment, to stop fucking around, and take it
seriously, to some extent at least.</p>
<h2 id="why-be-good-at-chess-">Why be good at chess?</h2>
<p>I mean, it&#39;s <em>just a game</em>.</p>

<p>What is my goal?</p>
<p>the goal, though this might shift, is 1500 on chess.com, 1700 on lichess.</p>
<p>Why? because 1500 is &quot;where people start&quot; according to Aman Hambleton. it&#39;s
also eminently achievable. We&#39;re not talking about becoming a damn grandmaster
here, we&#39;re just talking about becoming demonstrably better, dare I even say
<em>good</em> in a general sense, at fucking chess, huh?</p>
<p>What&#39;s the plan?</p>
<p>The plan is, and this is key, <em>no more blitz</em>. Blitz is terrible for getting
better! It&#39;s only good for playing blitz. Your pattern recognition doesn&#39;t have
time to solidify when you&#39;re just playing game after game after game of garbage
blitz gambits and whoever manages not to fuck up first wins. It&#39;s like trying
to learn to play charlie parker heads at tempo. It&#39;s nuts! So no more blitz games.</p>
<p>No more distracted games.</p>
<p>I used to play at the bus stop. Bus comes? Resign. I used to play on the
toilet. I used to play while watching TV. Why am I surprised I lost so much?
I&#39;m not applying my attention to the game, and again, mostly playing garbage
blitz games. What did I expect to happen?</p>
<p>No more resigning.</p>
<p>I used to resign when the bus comes, sure, but I knew the bus was going to
come, that&#39;s why I was at the bus stop. But I would resign if I got distracted,
or if I just didn&#39;t want to play anymore, or if I lost a minor piece or felt
like I screwed up or just in general felt like I wasn&#39;t going to win. This is
the <em>wrong</em> attitude. At the level I and my opponents are at right now,
<em>anything</em> can happen. Oh so I blundered a knight? Wait 5 more moves and there
might just be a family fork waiting for me. Completely lost endgame? You will
be shocked and amazed at your fellow 1200&#39;s inability to avoid stalemating you
with a queen and a knight. <em>Make them win</em>. Make them work for it! Resignation
is an admission of defeat in the face of utter hopelessness. It&#39;s a sign of
faith in your opponent&#39;s ability, and respect for their knowledge and skill, to
accurately play out the position. Do you have that faith? Is that respect due?
Do you think a 1000 rated player will win 100% of the games that they are up a
minor piece? Do you think <em>you</em> would? Make them play it out. Go for the draw,
find a stalemate.  I&#39;ll only resign from now on if I am both certain I am going
to lose <em>and</em> that my opponent knows how to checkmate me. But even then, why
not make them do it?</p>

<p>My first goal was to get my tactics rating to 1800. chess.com has tactics
trainers. I though this step would take me until the end of the year, but
actually it only took me a week to get it to 2000. Wow! Grandmaster here I
come. Just kidding.</p>
<p>a rant on ratings</p>
<p>why tactics ratings are higher</p>
<p>Play <em>ONE GAME A WEEK</em> 15:10 rapid, as suggested by john bartholmew here
(insert link). Make a big deal out of it. Make a cup of tea, turn off all the
distractions, and play a full ass game as well as you possibly can. Then
analyze it afterwards. If I assume I&#39;ll skip a week here or there, this is
around 50 full games. That&#39;s actually a lot of games! I <em>know</em> that I&#39;m capable
of 1500 level play right now, on a good day, with focus. But I need to prove
that, consistently, to actually achieve the rating.</p>
<p>Endgame study.</p>
<p>You would think I would start with some openings, right? Tactics and openings
seem like a good place to begin. But the truth is I&#39;ve lost way more games from
a lack of endgame knowledge than from a lack of opening knowledge. Openings can
get <em>really</em> intricate and deep, people analyze theory many levels deep to get
insight into what positions are most beneficial for either side. But again, I&#39;m
playing people at my level, remember? The opening is mostly about development
and avoiding gotchas. I already have an opening repertoire, and it&#39;s kind of
bad but I&#39;ve been playing it long enough to know how to get to the middlegame
unscathed most always, which is enough for now. I&#39;m going to add the sicilian
against e4 and the giuoco piano for my own e4, I already play the indian
against d4 so I should just properly study that one, it&#39;s pretty out there. If
I have a d4/e4 openings for white and a preferred defense for same, well that
covers 90 percent of games doesn&#39;t it? I think beginners and intermediates get
scared off by openings because of how masters talk about them, but we&#39;re
operating at a completely different, lower level. You don&#39;t have to study
oodles of theory to &quot;study openings&quot;, you just have to have a basic idea of the
structure of the first 5 or so moves and move from there into the middlegame. I
promise you your 1200 opponent will not have more knowledge than that, either.
Just get through the opening.</p>
