title: '"The Chorder" prototype'
---

I wrote [this](https://github.com/urthbound/chorder) program a few months ago.
It's visually minimal, but it can generate over a thousand valid chord shapes.
I wrote it in Ruby and wrapped it in <a href="http://shoesrb.com/"
target="_blank">Shoes</a>. Instead of prettifying it, I decided to refactor the
whole project and build it into a web app, while extending it's functionality
to include Drop 3, Drop 2/3, and Drop 2/4 voicings and inversions. That's in
the pipes.

I'm  planning to use this as a base from which to write a program that can
output properly voice-led arrangements of any jazz tune by reading charts from
the <a href="http://musiccog.ohio-state.edu/home/index.php/iRb_Jazz_Corpus"
target="_blank">iRb Jazz Corpus</a>, which I'm making good progress with but
will elaborate on in a future post.

If you'd like to run this version, you can<a
href="http://shoesrb.com/downloads/" target="_blank"> download the shoes
interpreter here</a> and open the source in the shoes GUI. If you're
command-line savvy, you could also <a
href="https://github.com/urthbound/chorder" target="_blank">clone the github
repo</a> and run a terminal interface via `$ruby interface.rb` that accesses
the same logic.

The left hand side has five main groups of buttons:

- root note
- accidental
- chord quality
- inversion
- string set

The program will also accommodate open strings and notes that fall above the
12th fret.
