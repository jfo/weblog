<a href="http://replit.com/Kr0/1" target="_blank">Run that junk.</a>

A couple of weeks ago I got it into my pointy little egg-head that I wanted to
write a
[fizzbuzz](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/02/fizzbuzz-the-programmers-stairway-to-heaven.html)
in [brainfuck](http://www.jeffalanfowler.com/blog/how-brainfuck-works/)
As with a lot of the stupid ideas that occur to me, I initially dismissed it as
a waste of time, as-well-I-had-ought-to-have-done.

"Nahhhhhhh," past me said to himself, chuckling, "that would be totally,
needlessly hard right now, and it would take a lot of time, and anyway I don't
know how I would even START! Unless, maybe, well... I wonder if I could write
an if/else... and then if I could do that...maybe with a multiples counter
cell...and...."

And so [after a quick googling](http://esolangs.org/wiki/brainfuck_algorithms)
I was off. I had [nerd-sniped](http://xkcd.com/356/) myself!

I decided the easiest way to go about it was to write fizzbuzz in Ruby, first,
and then translate it into brainfuck. Aww Ruby, <a
href="http://replit.com/Kr2/1" target="_blank">you so pretty with your little
modulos and all that ish.</a> But of course I couldn't use anything more
complicated than an if/else statement, and I had to do everything incrementally
by 1, as well... and I could only stop loops by allowing their index counter to
reach zero, not when it got to a certain high number like 100... hmmmmmm.

It looks a little unwieldy, but I used numbers spelled out as variable names to
stand for the address of the memory cell that I would eventually use in
brainfuck. The variables could only be set to numbers, and until loops can only
be set to terminate at zero. I started by writing a program that simply counts
to 100 without any of the divisor logic.

First I needed to mark how high I was going to count. We're going to 100, so I
need a 1 in the hundreds loop counter, a 10 in the tens loop counter, and a 10
in the ones loop counter to start with:

```ruby
seven = 1
eight = 10
nine = 10
```

Those are the indices; they are going to be going down. Now I need the memory
slots holding the actual numerals that are going to be printed... including one
slot that holds a new line character I can access so not everything comes out
all smashed together, because I can't use `puts`:

```ruby
ten = "/n"
eleven = 0
twelve = 0
thirteen = 0
```

Now I'll just create some nested loops to do the counting (up in the printed
slots' case and down in the index slots' case):

```ruby
  until seven == 0
    until eight == 0
        until nine == 0
            print ten       #prints the newline
            print eleven    #prints the hundreds place
            print twelve    #prints the tens place
            print thirteen  #prints the ones place

            nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
            thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot
        end

        nine = 10           #resets the ones place index slot
        eight -=1           #decrements the tens place index slot

        twelve += 1         #increments the tens place print slot
        thirteen = 0        #resets the ones place print slot
    end

  eight = 10                  #resets the tens place index slot
  seven -= 1                  #decrements the hundreds place index slot

  eleven += 1                 #increments the hundreds place print slot
  twelve = 0                  #resets the tens place print slot
end
```

Okay- still Ruby... ugly, non-Rubyish Ruby, but now it is nothing I can't do in
brainfuck.

But we haven't done the hard part yet- implementing the logic that will filter
out the multiples of 3 and 5 and replace them with "Fizz" and "Buzz." In Ruby
or any other higher level language, this program practically writes itself with
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation"
target="_blank">modulo operation</a>, which returns zero if a number is evenly
divisible by another number and leaves no remainder. But brainfuck, of course,
doesn't have this operation, and remember- it's conditional loops can only be
triggered by a "0" in the memory slot that is being evaluated, anyway.

This one took a little bit of thought, but a solution was forthcoming. I add
two more index cells:

```ruby
five = 3
six = 5
```

and decrement both of those each time I print a number out- when the "3" index
slot reaches zero, I know I have found a multiple of 3 and can use that spot to
trigger the code to print "Fizz" (and to reset the index back to 3- or rather 2
actually, since that accounts for the<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error" target="_blank"> ol' off
by one</a>) instead of the code to print the number. Ditto for "Buzz."

Here is what all this looks like...

```ruby
five = 3
six = 5

seven = 1
eight = 10
nine = 10

ten = "\n"
eleven = 0
twelve = 0
thirteen = 0

 until seven == 0
    until eight == 0
        until nine == 0

            if five == 0
                print ten      #don't forget the newline!
                print "Fizz"
                five = 2
                six -= 1
                nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot
            elsif six == 0
                print ten
                print "Buzz"
                six = 4
                five -= 1
                nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot
            else
                print ten       #prints the newline
                print eleven    #prints the hundreds place
                print twelve    #prints the tens place
                print thirteen  #prints the ones place

                nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot

                five -= 1       #decrements the multiple of 3 tracker
                six -= 1        #decrements the multiple of 5 tracker
            end
        end

        nine = 10           #resets the ones place index slot
        eight -=1           #decrements the tens place index slot

        twelve += 1         #increments the tens place print slot
        thirteen = 0        #resets the ones place print slot
    end

eight = 10                  #resets the tens place index slot
seven -= 1                  #decrements the hundreds place index slot

eleven += 1                 #increments the hundreds place print slot
twelve = 0                  #resets the tens place print slot
end

#since the above loop is set to terminate at the top after it reaches 100, that
#final number won't get printed. I'll print it below:

print ten
print eleven
print twelve
print thirteen
```

Now, before printing the number, the program checks to see if it is a multiple
of three or five...only when it is not  divisible by either does it print the
number itself.

This totally works! But there are some issues- I can't use elsifs in brainfuck-
the algorithms I've researched aren't that sophisticated, and I haven't
implemented "FizzBuzz" for the numbers that are multiples of both- the logic
catches them on "Fizz" and skips over the other bits. Also there is some
needless repetition with the newlines, though I'm actually going to need some
of that later on so I'll leave it for now.

I can't use explicit elsifs to evaluate mutliple possible states... but I CAN
do that evaluation in series as two nested if/else statements, which is all
elsif is shorthand for anyway... and I can deal with those! Now it looks
like this:

```ruby
five = 3
six = 5

seven = 1
eight = 10
nine = 10

ten = "\n"
eleven = 0
twelve = 0
thirteen = 0

 until seven == 0
    until eight == 0
        until nine == 0

            if five == 0

                print ten      #don't forget the newline!
                print "Fizz"
                five = 2
                six -= 1
                nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot

            else

                if six == 0

                    print ten
                    print "Buzz"
                    six = 4
                    five -= 1
                    nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                    thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot

                else

                    print ten       #prints the newline
                    print eleven    #prints the hundreds place
                    print twelve    #prints the tens place
                    print thirteen  #prints the ones place

                    nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                    thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot

                    five -= 1       #decrements the multiple of 3 tracker
                    six -= 1        #decrements the multiple of 5 tracker
                end
            end
        end

        nine = 10           #resets the ones place index slot
        eight -=1           #decrements the tens place index slot

        twelve += 1         #increments the tens place print slot
        thirteen = 0        #resets the ones place print slot
    end

eight = 10                  #resets the tens place index slot
seven -= 1                  #decrements the hundreds place index slot

eleven += 1                 #increments the hundreds place print slot
twelve = 0                  #resets the tens place print slot
end

#since the above loop is set to terminate at the top after it reaches 100, that
#final number won't get printed. I'll print it below:

print ten
print eleven
print twelve
print thirteen
```


Aside from the repetition we are ignoring- there are three problems left. Still
no "FizzBuzz," and when it should make "FizzBuzz," it throws off the 5's
counter into negative numbers so it never prints Buzz after 15. And it's not
evaluating 100. The first and second problem can be fixed with just one more
"if" statement, nuzzled way down in the bowels of our<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code" target="_blank">
increasingly complex</a>program. We know we'll only have to write "FizzBuzz" if
we've already written "Fizz," so anytime we print "Fizz," we just throw in an
extra check against whether or not we need to write "Buzz." Now, if we write
"FizzBuzz", we will also be resetting the 5's counter.

Oh and as for the last problem, I just hardcoded printing "Buzz" out at the end
instead of "100", bypassing all the logic, because I'm a filthy, cheating,
dirty fraud. YOLO####33<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-1-phenomenon"
target="_blank">3</a>. Also because it will always end up on a multiple of 100,
so at least the "Buzz" part will be right. Screw you, 300, 600, and 900!!

```ruby
five = 3
six = 5

seven = 1
eight = 10
nine = 10

ten = "\n"
eleven = 0
twelve = 0
thirteen = 0

 until seven == 0
    until eight == 0
        until nine == 0

            if five == 0

                print ten      #don't forget the newline!
                print "Fizz"

                if six == 0
                    print "Buzz"
                    six = 5
                end

                five = 2
                six -= 1
                nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot

            else

                if six == 0

                    print ten
                    print "Buzz"
                    six = 4
                    five -= 1
                    nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                    thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot

                else

                    print ten       #prints the newline
                    print eleven    #prints the hundreds place
                    print twelve    #prints the tens place
                    print thirteen  #prints the ones place

                    nine -= 1       #decrements the ones index slot
                    thirteen += 1   #increments the ones print slot

                    five -= 1       #decrements the multiple of 3 tracker
                    six -= 1        #decrements the multiple of 5 tracker
                end
            end
        end

        nine = 10           #resets the ones place index slot
        eight -=1           #decrements the tens place index slot

        twelve += 1         #increments the tens place print slot
        thirteen = 0        #resets the ones place print slot
    end

eight = 10                  #resets the tens place index slot
seven -= 1                  #decrements the hundreds place index slot

eleven += 1                 #increments the hundreds place print slot
twelve = 0                  #resets the tens place print slot
end

# Since the above loop is set to terminate at the top after it reaches 100, that
# final number won't get printed. I'll print it below:

print ten
print "Buzz" #dirty cheater.
```

So I've written the whole program in a way that brainfuck can accommodate. The
next step is to translate it. Bleep, bloop, bleep! I'm going to write that in a
separate post, because this is getting pretty long. Also if you want to
increase the maximum number that you're evaluating, try changing the initial
index of the hundreds place in the above code! It will go for as long as you
want it to, because it will just continue to print higher numbers because it is
Ruby! brainfuck wouldn't be able to do that past 999, because we would need to
implement a new loop to print the thousands place, because it is printing
strings of digits instead of numbers. We'll get to that next time.
