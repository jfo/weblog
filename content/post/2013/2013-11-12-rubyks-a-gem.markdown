title: Rubyks, a gem
---

After writing the initial iteration of the [The
Chorder](the-chorder-prototype/), I started thinking about other
systems that I might be able to model, and the rubiks cube seemed perfect. It
is visual, easy to conceptualize, and completely contained- any possible
combination can be arrived at by starting at the solved cube (the "base case")
and shuffling. All I had to do was model the state of the cube in some sort of
data structure and implement the various transformations accurately and the
program would be accurate. Easy, right?!


And actually, it was pretty easy... not at first, necessarily- there was a fair
amount of head scratching about how, exactly, I was going to store the state of
the cube at any one time (I'm not convinced I picked the best method, either...
but more on that later...)

I eventually settled on a two dimensional array containing 6 other arrays (one
for each face of the whole cube) of 9 elements each (one for each square on
each face.) More about the structure from the README:

```ruby
@cube[0] - top
@cube[1] - left
@cube[2] - back
@cube[3] - right
@cube[4] - front
@cube[5] - bottom
```

The first element `@cube[x][0]` in any array describes the center square of
that face, and remains static in relation to the other sides, just as a real
cube's center square would.

The remaining array elements from [1] - [8] start at "12 o'clock" and move
clockwise. Thus: Even numbers are middle cubies and odd numbers are always
corner cubies.

"12 o'clock" is constant amongst all sides of the cube, and refers to what
"north" would be if the cube was unfolded into two dimensions like so:

```
    1
5,4,0,2
    3
```

When cube orientation procedures are applied, the "address" of each side
remains consistent with the above diagram, even as the sides themselves
represent different numbers. (The sides could just as easily be assigned any
symbol or string or whatnott, just as long as each side started off all the
same thing, the cube would be in a legal state).

If you created a new cube and then applied Cube#turn, the sides would appear
like so:

```
    4
5,3,0,1
    2
```

But the address of the location of these sides would remain static. This is so
that complex move combinations can be applied to a cube regardless of its
orientation to the "viewer."

This does have the advantage of offering a static "address" for each mini
square on each face of the cube, but doesn't offer any scalability- I can't
instantiate a cube of an arbitrary size (like Cube.new(n), for example) because
the relationships between the different faces is defined in the methods that
act upon them, and not in the data structure itself.

After the data structure was designed, implementing the transformations was
fairly straightforward. there are only 6 basic moves- each face can be turned
clockwise once (turning a face counterclockwise is the same as turning it
clockwise three times). here is the method for turning the top face clockwise
once:

```ruby
def u
    cubetemp = Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(@cube))

    cubetemp[1][4] = @cube[4][2]
    cubetemp[1][5] = @cube[4][3]
    cubetemp[1][6] = @cube[4][4]

    cubetemp[4][2] = @cube[3][8]
    cubetemp[4][3] = @cube[3][1]
    cubetemp[4][4] = @cube[3][2]

    cubetemp[3][8] = @cube[2][6]
    cubetemp[3][1] = @cube[2][7]
    cubetemp[3][2] = @cube[2][8]

    cubetemp[2][6] = @cube[1][4]
    cubetemp[2][7] = @cube[1][5]
    cubetemp[2][8] = @cube[1][6]

    cubetemp[0][1] = @cube[0][7]
    cubetemp[0][2] = @cube[0][8]
    cubetemp[0][3] = @cube[0][1]
    cubetemp[0][4] = @cube[0][2]
    cubetemp[0][5] = @cube[0][3]
    cubetemp[0][6] = @cube[0][4]
    cubetemp[0][7] = @cube[0][5]
    cubetemp[0][8] = @cube[0][6]

    @hist << 'u'
    @cube = Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(cubetemp))
    self
  end
```


Simple- just reassigning all the colors based on how the cube is moving. Notice
that, because I didn't understand deep copying of data, I used the (then
magical) "Marshal" incantation to create a duplicate temporary array to operate
on before I redumped the transformed state back into the main attribute. If I
didn't do that, the color assignment would happen sequentially on the main data
structure and it wouldn't be able to properly assign the new values.

Marshal, by the way, is Ruby's serialization module... it takes any type of
data and turns it into a simple byte stream. This was totally overkill. I
should have just made a brand new deep copied array by using Array#dup, which
does the same thing in a simpler, more secure way. Maybe I'll update that.

also wrote a little interface to interact with the model.

I packaged all this up as a Gem and made it available at <a

anyone who wants to make use of my data structure and transformation methods to
write their own solver.
