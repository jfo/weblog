title: I'll Come Back Someday
---

<a href="https://myspace.com/jefffowler/music/song/i-ll-come-back-someday-25571490-25372675?play=1" target="_blank">Here's another song from waaaaaaay back.  </a>

I don't even know where this song <em>is</em> anymore. Probably buried deep within some backup of a backup of a backup drive. And it's on <em>myspace</em> for cryaahefu out loud.. I haven't even logged into myspace for years.

But it still exists, like internet amber. It would feel strange to delete it.
