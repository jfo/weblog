So now I have a software model of a rubik's cube. But how would I go about
writing a program that can manipulate that model from any legal position and
solve it?

This was also a major nerd snipe on myself, much like the fizzbuzz in brainfuck
that ate up a full weekend a few weeks ago. At first, I figured that this was
out of my paygrade-- so many better solvers have been written. I'm not even
that good of a cuber! I learned to solve it in college but only ever learned
one method- it works every time but is not the most efficient solution by any
means. I would have to learn new algorithms and strategies if I wanted to write
a program that would work well. But then...

Really, the point of the exercise was not to write a fast, efficient program-
but rather to attempt to model my own logical process when I solve an "analog"
cube. For that- this was a perfect test problem, so that's what I did.

As I said in the last post, implementing the basic transformations was pretty
easy. Using those methods in series to build helper methods that perform even
complex algorithms was as simple as stringing them together on a single Cube
object and then returning that object. Like this:

```ruby
#Re-orients cubies of [0][4], [0][6], and [0][8] without affecting anything else.
def last_move
    self.rr.d.d.r.f.d.d.fr.ur.f.d.d.fr.rr.d.d.r.u
    self
end
```

That's the most long winded combination in my repertoire, used to reorient the
final cubies to their proper faces.

I planned out the solution by thinking of the steps I use normally:

1. top cross
2. corners next to the top cross
3. second level middles
4. last level cross
5. last level corners

So I implemented solving methods for each of these. Basically, each step
repeats a set of motions that don't change the effects of the previous step
until some condition is satisfied. Here is the top cross method for an example:

```ruby
##Solves for cross on first layer. Affects all other layers.
def cross_solve
    downcross = []
    i = 1
    until @cube[0][1] == @cube[0][0] && @cube[0][3] == @cube[0][0] && @cube[0][5] == @cube[0][0] && @cube[0][7] == @cube[0][0]

        until downcross.include?(@cube[0][0])
            downcross = []
            self.rr.d.r.l.dr.lr.turn
            downcross = [@cube[5][1],@cube[5][3],@cube[5][5], @cube[5][7]]
            i += 1
            if i > 10
                self.turn until @cube[0][1] != @cube[0][0]
                self.l.b
                i = 1
            end
        end

        until @cube[5][3] == cube[0][0]
            i =0
            self.d

            if i > 59
                self.print
                gets
            end
            i+=1
        end

        until @cube[0][7] != @cube[0][0]
            self.u
        end
        self.f.f
        downcross = []
    end

    until @cube[4][3] == @cube[4][0] && @cube[1][5] == @cube[1][0]
        until @cube[1][5] == @cube[1][0]
            self.u
        end
        self.turn if @cube[4][3] != @cube[4][0]
        i += 1

        if i > 10
            self.cross_swap
            i = 1
        end
    end

    if @cube[2][7] != @cube[2][0]
        self.cross_swap
    end

    self
end
```

It is a very dumb, brute force solving method. I also included several
conditionals that trip if the loop has iterated a certain number of times;
these act like a tilt- jogging things around just enough to change whatever was
causing the loop to lock up.

And so on down the line, until the cube is solved.

The final method to call all of these layers in sequence looks something like
this:

```ruby
#solve invokes all layer solving methods in sequence, solving from any legal state
def simple_solve
    testarray = []
    @cube.each {|side| testarray << side.uniq}
    return self if testarray.flatten.length == 6

    self.cross_solve.corners_solve.second_layer_solve.top_cross.top_corners
    self
end
```

Note that it always checks to see if the cube is ALREADY solved before mucking
it up!

Going through the process of modeling my own behavior was enlightening. The
computer is very, very stupid, but if you give it explicit enough instructions
that are able to handle any possible cases, it can do almost any logical
process.
