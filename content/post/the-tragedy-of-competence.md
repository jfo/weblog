title:  "The Tragedy of Competence"
draft: true
---


The basic idea is that as we become used to being, feeling competent, we lose
the perspective we had at the beginning. This is a non-controversial concept.

Everyone knows about "beginner's mind."

Fake it till you make it is horseshit. In my experience the only people that
say this are assholes and failures, and many times the intersection of those.

New technologies become frivolous, silly.

If you have reached a level of competence, knowledge in your field, then you
have definitely seen things come and go. The great likelihood is that you've
seen _many, many_ more things come and *go* than things that come _and stay_.
By definition, the areas in which you might have built a career express a
survivorship bias to some degree. It becomes very easy, then, to poo poo new
technologies- and in the vast majority of cases, you'll be totally right!

_But sometimes you'll be totally wrong_.
