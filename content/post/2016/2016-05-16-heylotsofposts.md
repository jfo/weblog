title: Hey, a lot of posts!
---

So, I haven't posted anything on here in a while. Actually, today is the one
year anniversary of the last time I posted anything on this blog. That is ridiculous!

I tell you what. I'm going to post more things. I promise. No, I guarantee it.

How can I be so sure? Isn't this a thing that people write on their own little
blogs like, all the time? 

Yeah, it totally is. I'm guilty of it myself. "Oh I'm sorry there haven't been
many posts, I'll do better!" And then... nothing. Or one or two posts and
then... nothing.

But there is a difference this time. Those posts I would be promising? _I've
already written them_. A lot of them! In all, about _50,000 words worth_ of
them. All I have to do is final edit and post them, and even _I'm_ not lazy
enough to avoid doing that.

So like, follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jeffowler) or whatever, if
you want to. I'll be posting about the posts there. Also zulip, for the RC
folk, with the programming related ones, which is all of them, currently.


Here, I'll kick things off with some ascii art I made. It's a herring.

```
.        `\\\,
|\ _.--''""````"''--._
  }                 o `\
|/ '--.._____'`'_._..~~`
`
```

That will make more sense later. I promise.
