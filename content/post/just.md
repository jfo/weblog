<span style="color: red;">Person A</span>: yeah, it's simple, see? it's just a function.

<span style="color: blue;">Person B</span>: So this is a function, which is what... a type of generalized
description of some arbitrary algorithmic procedure, and in this particular
case a textual representation of same in a particular but likewise arbitrary
programming language and syntax, and is in practice here interpreted by a _virtual_
machine, which is itself, a bunch of code and functions and stuff, which is
just data, which is numbers, basically, running on a _real_ machine, which is a
bunch of transistors and chips and hoobledy gock and whatsits that redirect
electricity really quickly in different ways that we read back to get answers
to math problems? So we're just _harnessing lightning to do math?_ That's
amazing!
