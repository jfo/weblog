the "arc" of justs.

it's just a function? what is a function? it's a textual representation of an
algorithmic procedure.

that sounds pretty general, couldn't that do anything in a turing complete
language which is all of them really kind of I mean except for markup?

well yeah.

that doesn't sound so simple. Wait you said it was a textual representation, or
description. text doesn't do anything by itself, how does that do computer
then?

well it runs in a virtual machine, which interprets the text.

why do we need a virtual machine? we have a real machine right here!

well, this blublang over here is interpreted, so it has to have a runtime. some
languages are compiled.

doesn't this runtime have a jit? so it's compiled... sometimes? when?

I don't know, it depends.

on what?

a bunch of stuff... the architecture, the performance characteristics of the
code, how it's being used as the program runs...

that doesn't sound simple.

you're not listening, it's just a function.

ok so there is a virtual machine interpreting text I'm writing, fine, but
surely the virtual machine runs on a real machine, right?

I mean, most of the time... sure why not. yes.

so what interprets the virtual machine?

oh that's compiled to machine code.

ok so what's machine code?

data

what's data?

numbers, sort of.

what's a number?

go talk to the haskell people, man, what were you even asking me about again?

I'm just trying to understand what a function is... what _this_ function is, is
all. So the virtual machine is compiled code which is run on a real machine and
the code is data which is basically numbers but what is the machine?

it's a bunch of chips and memory and stuff.

what are those.

mostly transistors? nand gates?

what are those?

they're electronic components that, when structured in a very particular way,
allow us to represent discrete boolean values by alternately storing and
redirecting an electrical charge really really quickly.

so that's how we do math? with electricity?

yeah, it's simple, see? it's just a function.


so you're telling me, that a function, being a generalized description of some
arbitrary algorithmic procedure, and in this particular case a textual
representation of same in a particular but likewise arbitrary language and
syntax, is in practice interpreted by a _virtual_ machine, which is itself, a
bunch of code and functions and stuff, which is just data, which is numbers,
basically, running on a _real_ machine, which is a bunch of transistors and
chips and hoobledy gock and whatsits that redirect electricity really quickly
in different ways that we read back to get answers to math problems? So we're
just _harnessing lightning to do math?_ That's amazing!


yeah, it's really simple, it's just a function.
