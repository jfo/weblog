Person B: I just don't understand why you are so dismissive. Saying
"it's just a function" completely obscures and minimizes so much.

Person A: Hey look, I'm with you, all right? I have admiration for the triumphs
of modern technology and am suitably filled with similar awe when I take a
moment to sit back and consider the tower of abstractions we've built the
modern world on top of, but the abstractions go all the way down. The only way
we can move forward, ever, or more appropriately to the metaphor, upwards, is
to pick out some point on that tower below which we don't bother with.
Fundamentally, it's a tradeoff. The lower down you go, the more control you
have over everything, but the more work it takes to do anything. The higher up
you go, the more you have to rely on abstractions you had no hand in building,
but they become more and more powerful, and you can do a lot more a lot faster.
You have to sit at the appropriate place on this pile of abstractions, both for
where you are in your understanding and for what is appropriate to the task
you're trying to complete. I'm sorry if I seemed dismissive, I didn't mean it
that way.

Person B: I guess we both have a point.
