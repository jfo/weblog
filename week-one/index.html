<p>Anyway, week in review- what have I learned so far, concretely?</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;git add -p&#39; for reviewing each and every change you made before committing
it</li>
<li>&#39;git commit --amend&#39; for opening up your last commit and making changes to it</li>
<li>&#39;Ctrl+R&#39; to search through old CLI commands</li>
<li>&#39;diff&#39;</li>
<li>what a &#39;trie&#39; is</li>
<li>what a &#39;queue&#39; is</li>
<li>depth-first vs breadth-first search</li>
<li>that vim doesn&#39;t source my .zshrc by default</li>
<li>state-machine</li>
<li>void returns in C</li>
<li>the basics of list comprehensions in Python</li>
<li>etc etc etc... and on and on and on...</li>
</ul>
<p>these are just <em>facts</em>, and random things, but they are actual tidbits of
knowledge that I actually remember because I learned them &#39;in the stream,&#39; as
it were.</p>
<p>This is a funny place to be, but it feels really natural... everything you do
here is one hundred percent your own decision. It&#39;s incredible to note that
<em>everyone</em> is working <em>all the time</em>. The real time chat we use is constantly
on fire with threads about all kinds of arcana from assembly specs to keyboard
reviews to places to eat lunch.</p>
<p>Also, I got to try an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhcOMOWRMnA">Oculus
Rift</a>, which was <em>totally rad</em>.</p>
<p>The question of what exactly to work on while here is a big one- but there is
certainly no lack of ideas. Every single person I talked to was working on
something interesting, and the huge variance in people&#39;s backgrounds virtually
guarantees that you can both learn something from and teach something to anyone
in the room.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been going through the last couple of chapters of
<a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">nand2tetris</a> and hope to have the book done in
the next couple of days so that I don&#39;t have to think about it anymore. It&#39;s
been an <em>incredible</em> learning experience, but I do want to maximize the time
that I spend pairing and shipping while I&#39;m here, and nand feels like it&#39;s best
done on one&#39;s own and in isolation (at least, that&#39;s the way I&#39;ve enjoyed doing
it... though the toolset that I composed with Ruby is <em>really, really</em> ugly and
could use a refactor really badly!)</p>
<p>More later on specifics... I want to write a booklist of all the things I&#39;ve
read so far and all the things I hope to read, and hopefully in the next couple
of weeks I&#39;ll be able to get some clarity on what exactly I want to work
towards and what I want to learn- or at least narrow the scope of those things
to a manageable point.</p>
<p>Tonight, though, it&#39;s my birthday. So I&#39;m trudging out in the cold and getting
some sushi. Had a preemptive small party last weekend with lots of singing and
nerdery, and I&#39;ll post some videos from that pretty soon. It&#39;s pretty fun to
get a room full of musicians drunk and then play &quot;lets listen to a song once
and then play a fully realized arrangement of it yay lets go GO HARMONY
EVERYWHERE!</p>
