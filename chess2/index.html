        <div><p>Let&#39;s take a bit of stock.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent almost 2 months not playing any blitz chess. What have I done with that time?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve done a ton of puzzles, usually up to 25 a day, and my chess.com puzzle
rating has hovered around 2000 that time. My goal is to continue doing the
puzzles there and maintain that score. Because of the vagaries of the chess.com
puzzle rating system, and the fact that generally speaking, the higher the
ratings go the more positional and combinational the solutions become, my goal
initially was to stare at them til I get it and do them fast on the puzzle
rush, instead,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started doing 3 chessable courses,</p>
<p>london for white
scandi for black (and responding to d5 with my busted pirc repertoire for now)
the endgame book.</p>
<p>Some observations: chessable is terrific, I really love it. It lets me drill
this stuff with <em>very little effort</em> on my part. This is good, because my
memory is shit but spaced repetition <em>really works</em>. It <em>is</em> slower going than
I expected, but honestly, if I just work through these three courses this year,
I predict my opening positions will improve dramatically.</p>
<p>Why did I pick these? I was originally going to start with endgames, but the
truth is my openings are just so boring and stale to me. I&#39;ve played shitty
kings indian for years, and my white is always just a middle attack knights
thing.</p>
<p>People make fun of the london, but it&#39;s got a lot going for it! It&#39;s flexible,
can be opened or closed depending on how you play it, it&#39;s solid, and can be
played against anything. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s passe, it&#39;s the thing I chose.
Also it&#39;s d4, which is a really good change for me.</p>
<p>Why the scandi? Similarly fashionable, and similarly maligned, but tbqh John
Bartholemew is a really good teacher and it ticks some other boxes, too. It
often castles kingside, so my positional knowledge from the kings indian is
relevant sometimes, it&#39;s unexpected at lower levels, I think, and it&#39;s quite
angular with sharp tactical opportunities.</p>
<p>My plan is to really commit to these openings for the year at least! Maybe next
year I&#39;ll do giuoco piano and kings indian for real real.</p>
<p>I lied though, I&#39;ve been sneaking some cheeky blitz games, first on anon but
the strength was weirdly high? I don&#39;t know, could just be becasue I&#39;m below
average but wow really?</p>
<p>got me over 1200 on chess.com, 1000th game badge for some reason, scandi:
<a href="https://www.chess.com/live/game/6305922617">https://www.chess.com/live/game/6305922617</a></p>
<p>got me over 1500 on lichess, london:

<p>I had a weird week, week of inaugeration etc, and I just kind of spiraled a bit
and played like 100 games on lichess. And SUCKED. I just kept losing, and I was
getting really upset with myself. It feels so personal, you know? Here I am
doing all these stupid puzzles and I&#39;m <em>worse</em> than a few months ago?</p>
<p>So first of all, I wasn&#39;t worse. I was fucking tired as fuck, and fried
mentally. The next day I played some games where I really focussed, and all
those points came back and more. I even got my highest lichess rating ever!
Which is dead average, and a good place to stop, but that&#39;s still pretty
remarkable considering I&#39;m playing new openings now.</p>
