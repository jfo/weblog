        <h1 class="title-thing">Hello 2017</h1>
        <sub>Jan 02, 2017</sub>
        <p></p>
        <div><p>This is a little bit of a retrospective post, and a little bit of a resolution
post. It feels quite gauche to me to catalog accomplishments, but I also
believe that it&#39;s really important to take a moment to appreciate what I&#39;ve
worked on, and future me will benefit from the record. Also I spend most of my
time thinking about things I&#39;ve done wrong, so writing this was a welcome
change.</p>
<hr>

<p>I had a really productive year! I released a <a href="https://jefffowler.bandcamp.com/album/jeff-fowler-trio">trio album of
standards</a>, something
I&#39;ve been wanting to do since I was 16 years old. I released an <a href="https://tobyjeffandmegan.bandcamp.com/album/cleveland">EP with Megan
and Toby</a>, that we made
on Toby&#39;s and my trip to Cleveland last winter. We&#39;re trying to do that again
this year, hopefully!</p>
<p>At work at Etsy, I ticked off the 2 year mark, and moved from feeling like a
rank novice to feeling like I genuinely contribute more than I take. I have my
amazing coworkers to thank for much of that. We shipped big projects, and the
team grew, too! I also got the chance to rotate on an infrastructure team,
seeing a whole different side of our stack than I usually do.</p>
<p>I wrote 32 (!) blog posts, more than any other year by far, for a total of
81,375 words. That&#39;s like a 200 page book! (Or a 500 page book, in 14 point
double spaced comic sans, anyway, at least according to this <a href="http://wordstopages.com/">totally legit
website</a> that I&#39;m sure is completely accurate...)</p>
<p>Most of those posts were about <a href="/sild-is-a-lisp-dialect/">Sild</a>, the lisp that
I &quot;finished&quot; writing this year after 3 attempts. I learned <em>so much</em> from that
project... I learned about lisps, and I learned about C and compilers and
memory allocation and a bunch of other things, and I started to learn about how
to express technical concepts in prose. That project was the biggest, hardest
thing I&#39;ve done so far, and I can honestly say it levelled me up in a <em>ton</em> of
ways, both obvious and subtle.</p>
<p>I wrote more and about more things this year than I ever have before in my
life, and I feel like for maybe the first time, I&#39;ve developed a prosaic voice,
and a writing workflow. And people actually <em>read</em> what I wrote! Sild was on
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11842776">the front page of Hacker News</a>,
and though I have my issues with the orange website, I can&#39;t deny that it was
thrilling to see the enormous spike in traffic, from all over the world, and I
was pleased that the comments were generally positive and even helped me
understand some things I was struggling with.</p>
<p><img src="/images/traffic2016.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>Writing so much helped me zero in on what and how I like to write! It turns out
I really enjoy writing <em>extremely procedurally detailed</em> posts about projects
I&#39;ve worked on. I don&#39;t want to position myself as an expert, I just want to be
<em>very thorough</em> and genuine and clear about what I did and what I learned doing
it and why and how! I feel like there is a <em>lot</em> of pedagogical value to that
perspective and voice, and I&#39;d like to continue working on it.</p>
<p>Oh and Sofie and I got a cat!  And it turned out to be an <em>awesome cat</em>,
that loves laps. If you want a cat in New York, check out <a href="http://www.anjelliclecats.com/">Anjellicle
Cats</a>... they work with <a href="https://www.konekonyc.com/">Koneko Cat
Cafe</a>, which is where we found Cara.</p>

<h1 id="2017">2017</h1>
<p>Some things I am thinking about trying to do this year:</p>
<h2 id="redefine-my-relationship-with-creativity-">Redefine my relationship with creativity.</h2>
<p>This is funny, because this was actually my <a href="/v-i-2/">first post</a> and my
resolution in 2013. I succeeded, wildly, but in a way I could never have
anticipated, because that was the year I started learning to program, just a
few months after posting that photo. (It was on wordpress before I ported it.)</p>
<p>I guess you could say this is an ongoing process, but concretely it means for
me this year figuring out how exactly I want to fit creativity and art and
music into my life. Music used to be the <em>only</em> thing I did, basically. Now
it&#39;s one of many things I do. That&#39;s a good thing! I feel much more balanced
and healthy! But not performing and teaching professionally means that if I
want to continue to improve on what I know and create music then I&#39;ll have to
be much more intentional about it. The <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeywithamirror">same goes for
photography</a>, something I used
to really enjoy but have let languish for years now as other pursuits filled up
my time.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not a given that I&#39;ll keep these things in my life, I may become too
swamped with other ambitions to keep my guitar chops up, or I might decide I
just don&#39;t have the energy to pursue photography anymore at all. But I don&#39;t
want to just let things happen to me, I want to remain <em>intentional</em> about how I
spend my time.</p>
<p>That said,</p>
<h2 id="make-and-listen-to-more-music">Make and listen to more music</h2>
<p>This is an easy one. I want to continue to make music, and more of it. I have
more specific thoughts on what that might mean and how that might look but they
aren&#39;t especially relevant right now, and will likely change.</p>
<p>I want to listen to more music and more actively listen to music, especially my
friends&#39; music. I know how hard they&#39;ve worked on it, and I have some extremely
talented friends! I&#39;m also very lucky that as a programmer I have an enormous
amount of multitaskable time in my day to day that can include music, I ought
to be more picky about what I listen to while wrangling javascript or whatever.</p>
<h2 id="fill-some-gaps-in-my-education-in-earnest">Fill some gaps in my education in earnest</h2>
<p>As a &quot;self taught&quot; engineer (I have issues with that term, but you know what I
mean...) with an MM in Music and a BA in English, it&#39;s almost a given that I&#39;ll
lack quite a bit of knowledge when it comes to teh computings. But as I enter
my (almost) fourth year as a programmer (holy shit), I&#39;ve actually filled in
quite a great many of those gaps. I feel pretty confident in what I know, now,
especially considering how recently I&#39;ve come to the field, but the flipside to
that is that I really do appreciate what I still don&#39;t know, and oh sweet
little baby Jesus is there a lot of it.</p>
<p>There are a plenty of things that a traditional CS education provides that I
simply won&#39;t run into that often in my day to day. Algorithms and data
structures are the canonical examples, they&#39;re useful in my work sometimes, and
occasionally make a <em>very big</em> difference in the performance of some task or
application I might be working on, but I could just as easily stumble through a
web development career with the essentially cursory understanding of them that
I have right now. And in any case, I have experienced coworkers to ask when that
kind of thing comes up, right? Sure, now, most of the time. But they&#39;re not always
going to be around! And someday I would like to <em>be those people</em>, not just
<em>lean</em> on them. Also, I&#39;m like, super interested in this stuff! That&#39;s
ultimately why I do it!</p>
<p>There are so many ways to access this information, from online lectures on
youtube to coursera courses to books to forums... many sources that I&#39;ve
availed myself of before, but I&#39;ll have to be more consistent and controlled if
I want to truly fill in the gaps, not just study whatever occurs to me in
relation to whatever I&#39;m working on (not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that
of course!)</p>
<p>The other area that I need some serious halp with is math. I <em>suck</em> at math.
The only reason for this deficit is that I basically haven&#39;t done it since high
school, and let&#39;s just say I didn&#39;t have engaging math classes back then. In theory,
I <em>love</em> math!
<a href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/hair/a39171/dramatic-mens-makeover-haircut/">Bert</a>
and I even had a textbook reading club last year that we managed to keep going
for multiple weeks! But it&#39;s <em>hard</em> to learn really general, rudimentary abstract things
when that <em>fun project</em> is sitting in the back of your mind, especially
when <code>$FUN_PROJECT</code> also teaches you a ton of things!
<a href="https://twitter.com/_jak">James</a> gave us a <em>killer</em> booklist though, and even
though it might take me multiple years to get through it, having a defined path
to follow is a godsend for this kind of learning for me.</p>
<p>Speaking of books...</p>
<h2 id="read-more-dammit-">Read more dammit.</h2>
<p>And stop pretending the internet counts, because it doesn&#39;t. I&#39;ve got a ton of
books on my shelf that I&#39;ve been putting off, and I&#39;m going to read them,
dammit.</p>
<h2 id="take-my-health-seriously-">Take my health seriously.</h2>
<p>Look I know this is pretty quotidien but let&#39;s all lose those 50 pounds we&#39;ve been
carrying around, all right? And drink less, and eat better, and sleep better,
and meditate more, and generally not treat my body like shit.</p>
<div id="deeply"></div>

<h2 id="think-deeply-and-carefully-about-how-i-want-to-consume-and-be-consumed-by-media">Think deeply and carefully about how I want to consume and be consumed by media</h2>
<p>How do I really want to take in the world? What do I really want to read to get
my news? Who do I want to maintain relationships with in the world and online?
There are a lot of nasty defaults to these questions if you don&#39;t really
consider them. Do I really need to be facebook friends with that OKCupid date
from 2009? What value does maintaining that relationship really add to my life?
Do I really want to keep a facebook tab open all the time where I am at
continual risk of being tricked into clicking some dumbfuck slideshow link
because my lizard brain wants to see <code>$FEMALE_CELEB</code> in a tank top? What the fuck
even <em>is</em> facebook, and twitter? Who <em>are</em> these people?</p>
<p>These websites and others like them have the potential to add <em>real value</em> to
my life, and have. They&#39;ve kept me connected to or at least abreast of the lives of
many people I know and care about, and made it possible to have meaningful
interactions with <a href="https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/727148389930954754">people I really look up
to</a>, it&#39;s true.
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-people-commit-infosuicide">Infosuicide</a> is a
lovely, dark and deep idea. But baby and bathwater etc.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have to go nuclear to rethink how I interact with these services. I
don&#39;t have to remain logged into them and carry their ad tracking cookies
around with me to every website I visit. I don&#39;t have to share a curated
version of my life on them and read about others&#39; all the time, and I don&#39;t
intend to default to those things anymore.</p>
<p>This belongs to a wider category of things that I want to be more conscientious
about this year. This is the year I want to learn cryptography in earnest (see
above re: CS fundamentals) and decide if PGP encryption is a thing I want to
use. This is the year that I consider setting up a personal VPN and maybe using
Tor and Signal. This is the year that I stop being complacent about how I&#39;m
tracked and surveilled in all aspects of my online life.</p>
<h2 id="clean-up-my-dotfiles-https-github-com-jfo-dotfiles-">Clean up my <a href="https://github.com/jfo/dotfiles">dotfiles</a></h2>
<p>Yeah, sure, that deserves it&#39;s own top level header.</p>
<h2 id="rust-is-awesome-and-i-m-going-to-continue-to-learn-it-">Rust is awesome and I&#39;m going to continue to learn it!</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve really enjoyed working with Rust in the past few months, and the community
has been remarkably welcoming. It&#39;s a challenging language, but there is a lot
of really good work in there, and so much to learn.</p>
<h2 id="a-real-blog-redesign-">A real blog redesign.</h2>
<p>Someone on reddit pointed out how bad this blog looks on an android device.
Having recently switched to android myself, I wholeheartedly concur. This plus
<a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a> upgrading with breaking changes (pinning
me to the version I started with) means I might be looking at another
port. This may or may not involve writing my own static site generator.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about a real redesign for a while but I am not sure what I
want to do with it yet, visually. I definitely want it to stay super simple,
but I also want it to be easier to add photos without commiting them. This
might mean a Digital Ocean or AWS host for static assets, but again that likely
would require my own static site generator.</p>
<h2 id="more-blogging-but-less-blogging-">More blogging, but less blogging?</h2>
<p>I want to continue to write here. I&#39;ve been really pleased with the positive
impact working on this has had in my life. But I don&#39;t see myself writing as
much as I did last year. I haven&#39;t decided if I want to like do one post a
month at least or something? Or maybe write more often but shorter posts? Or
write more thot-leder things? I don&#39;t know yet! I have a few drafts sitting
around, but nothing very intricate.</p>
<h1 id="coda">Coda</h1>
<p>2016 was a really great year for me, when I really think about it. It was also,
for a variety of reasons, super fucking stressful. 2017 will likely not abate
that.</p>
<p>The common thread running through all of the aspirations I&#39;ve listed here is
<em>intention</em>. I want to learn how to be more controlled and intentional with how
I spend my time and what I do with it. I want to work harder and better, but
less. I want to make space for the things and people that really matter to me
and ruthlessly cut out the rest, and I want to give deep thought to what and
who those things and people are.</p>
<p>I guess that&#39;s my New Year&#39;s resolution, then.</p>
<p>2017 is going to be a really interesting year.</p>
