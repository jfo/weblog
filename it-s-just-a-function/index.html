        <div><p><span style="color: red;">Bob</span>: yeah, it&#39;s simple, see? it&#39;s just a
function.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue;">Alice</span>: So this is a just a function, which is
what... a type of generalized description of some arbitrary algorithmic
procedure, and in this particular case a textual representation of same in a
particular but likewise arbitrary programming language and syntax, and is in
practice here interpreted by a <em>virtual</em> machine, which is itself, a bunch of
code and functions and stuff, which is just data, which is numbers, basically,
running on a <em>real</em> machine, which is a bunch of transistors and chips and
hoobledy gock and whatsits that redirect electricity really quickly in
different ways that we read back to get answers to math problems? So we&#39;re just
<em>harnessing lightning to do math?</em> That&#39;s amazing!</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">Bob</span>: Yeah, it&#39;s really simple, it&#39;s <em>just</em> a
function.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue;">Alice</span>: I just don&#39;t understand why you are so
dismissive. Saying &quot;it&#39;s just a function&quot; completely obscures and minimizes so
much.</p>
<p><span style="color: red;">Bob</span>: Hey look, I&#39;m with you, all right? I have
admiration for the triumphs of modern technology and am suitably filled with
similar awe when I take a moment to sit back and consider the tower of
abstractions we&#39;ve built the modern world on top of, but the abstractions go
all the way down. The only way we can move forward, ever, or more appropriately
to the metaphor, upwards, is to pick out some point on that tower below which
we don&#39;t bother with.  Fundamentally, it&#39;s a tradeoff. The lower down you go,
the more control you have over everything, but the more work it takes to do
anything. The higher up you go, the more you have to rely on abstractions you
had no hand in building, but they become more and more powerful, and you can do
a lot more a lot faster.  You have to sit at the appropriate place on this pile
of abstractions, both for where you are in your understanding and for what is
appropriate to the task you&#39;re trying to complete. I&#39;m sorry if I seemed
dismissive, I didn&#39;t mean it that way.</p>
<p><span style="color: blue;">Alice</span>: I guess we both have a point.</p>
