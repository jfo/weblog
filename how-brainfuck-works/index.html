        <h1 class="title-thing">How Brainfuck Works</h1>
        <sub>Sep 13, 2013</sub>
        <p></p>
        <div><p>I got some good advice from <a href="http://piablumenthal.com/"
target="_blank">Pia</a>, who writes and makes such cool, cool  looking stuff,
and that advice was to treat a blog not like a personal journal, really, but
more like a way to provide your future self (at least) with documentation on
and about the things that you work on, do, make, etc. etc. etc. I like that
idea, thanks Pia.</p>
<p>So here is part one of a two part post on brainfuck, an actual name of an
actual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing
complete</a> programming language that people use for things. Sort of. Not
really though.</p>
<p>I lost my mind last weekend and learned the basics; I wrote a Ruby based
interpreter and a FizzBuzz, and when I was done I was unable to focus my eyes
which, according to Gabe, is &quot;Totally a thing!&quot;</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dawn-of-midi">Dawn of Midi<em></em></a>
is really good to listen to on day three of staring at something
incomprehensible, FYI.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<p>brainfuck interpreters recognize only 8 characters (<em>sometimes</em> 9, but
not really... back to that later):</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-literal">+</span>   <span class="hljs-literal">-</span>   <span class="hljs-title">[</span>   <span class="hljs-title">]</span>   <span class="hljs-string">.</span>   <span class="hljs-string">,</span>   &lt;   &gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Any and all spaces, extra characters, line breaks, etc, are completely ignored.
100%. The program really looks like a long string with no spaces consisting of
just those 8.  Before moving on, here are some interesting things I learned
recently that will make it easier to explain. Also, just as a side
note...<i> </i>I <em>loooove</em> little factoids like this, things that I
&quot;knew&quot; before, but didn&#39;t  really <a href="a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok&quot;">a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok&quot;</a>grok</a>. Ok. So:</p>
<p>A &quot;bit&quot; is the <em>smallest possible piece </em>of information. It is simply on
or off: 1 or 0, true or false. Bit is short for &quot;binary digit&quot;. One bit is one
binary digit- and a binary digit, being binary and all that, only has those two
possible states. On or off.</p>
<p>A &quot;byte&quot; is <em>eight</em> bits. In binary, eight digits provide you with 256
discrete values: 0-255 (0 counts as one of those). Any single byte can have a
value anywhere in that range.</p>
<p>Here, I&#39;ll count to 10 in binary:</p>

<pre><code>0000 0000
0000 0001
0000 0010
0000 0011
0000 0100
0000 0101
0000 0110
0000 0111
0000 1000
0000 1001
</code></pre>
<p>You might be able to intuit that if 0 looks like the top number, then 255 will
look like &quot;1111 1111&quot;. Of course, there is no need to have all those leading
zeroes, really, except to show that that would be the state of those bits in a
byte of memory that was holding those values. We&#39;ll just use the decimal
numbers for readability, but they can be represented either way and are
equivalent. They could also be represented in hex...</p>
<p>This is just like when you go from 0-9 in the ones place and then roll over
back to 0 adding 1 to the tens place, except that maximum value in any single
spot is &quot;1&quot;. I get it now! Base 2! Also this led to an AHA! moment concerning
the <a href="http://www.javascripter.net/faq/rgbtohex.htm"> RGB hexcodes</a>
that I have been looking at for years in Photoshop- they are simply three
concatenated two-digit <a href="a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal&quot;">a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal&quot;</a>hexadecimal numbers! </a></p>
<p>The brainfuck &quot;workspace&quot; (if I can call it that?) consists of two simple
things: An array of 30,000 memory slots, each containing just one byte (8 bits,
all initialized to hold 0), and a cursor that points to just one of those slots
at any one time (initialized to the very first slot.) It&#39;s basically a straight
software model of a <a href="a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine&quot;">a
href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine&quot;</a>Universal Turing
Machine.</a></p>
<p>Now we can understand what the first four symbols do.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck">&lt;   <span class="hljs-comment">moves the pointer to the left decreasingly</span>
&gt;   <span class="hljs-comment">moves the pointer to the right increasingly</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Usually, the location of the pointer will &quot;roll over&quot; if it goes below 0 or
above 30,000... (or above whatever the maximum number available is) effectively
making the memory cells act like one long circular tape.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-literal">+</span>   <span class="hljs-comment">increments the value of the byte at the current slot</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">-</span>   <span class="hljs-comment">decrements the value of the byte at the current slot</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. So here&#39;s a new brainfuck space, I&#39;ll only show 10 spots
because I am not going to type 30,000 (and the brackets surround where the
cursor is):</p>

<pre><code>[0] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
</code></pre>
<p>Pointer starts at one; everything is zero. Now if we ran this code:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-literal">+++</span>&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="hljs-literal">+</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-literal">--</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The memory array would end up looking like this:</p>

<pre><code> 3 0 0 1 [254] 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the decrementing of the fifth cell wrapped around to 255 instead of
going negative. A lot of modern interpreters don&#39;t stick to the one byte rule,
and can hold any value of any size, negative or not. At its most basic, though,
one byte per cell is all you would get. Notice also where the pointer ends up-
on the last cell it pointed to.</p>
<p>Two more symbols- the input and output.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-string">,</span>   <span class="hljs-comment">waits for the user to input a value and places it at the current cell</span>
<span class="hljs-string">.</span>   <span class="hljs-comment">outputs the value at the current cell (prints to screen)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The values 0-255 are mapped to characters using <a href="a
href=&quot;http://www.asciichart.com&quot;">a
href=&quot;http://www.asciichart.com&quot;</a>ASCII</a>- so if I wanted a cell to contain
the value &quot;103,&quot; I would press &quot;g&quot; (lowercase). Similarly, if the cell had a
value of 103 (&quot;0110 0111&quot; in binary, &quot;67&quot; in hexadecimal), and the program read
&quot;.&quot; it would print &quot;g&quot; to the screen.</p>
<p>So how you might make a brainfuck program output simple text to the screen- you
can have it say <i>anything</i> just using <code>+</code>,<code>-</code> and <code>.</code></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a super simple hello world:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-literal">++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>  
<span class="hljs-literal">+++++++</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">+++</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">++++++++++++++++++++++++</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">+++</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">------</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">--------</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">-------------------------------------------------------------------</span><span class="hljs-string">.</span>
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://repl.it/MBmv/0" target="_blank">Check it out here and run it.</a></p>
<p>Easy, right? You&#39;ll notice two things. It works great! and.. only the first
time, if you cut and paste the same thing below it again! Why is that? Well,
we&#39;re only acting on a single cell changing that single value directly until we
get to the appropriate ASCII character code for the letter or character we want
to print, and the cell is not reset between times you run the program, unless
you reload the page. Every time you run the code through the interpreter, it
starts out at the number the previous instance left it at. In our case: 33 ...
which is the value of the exclamation mark.  Each time you run the code, that
value goes up by 33, printing out gibberish.  Notice also that it goes
waaaaaaay above 255. This interpreter can hold way more than a single byte, and
is printing out Unicode values instead. [Edit: Gabe tells me it&#39;s still ASCII,
not Unicode...]</p>
<p>Let&#39;s fix it!</p>
<p>Add a <code>&gt;</code> right at the top, before anything else.</p>
<p>Now the very first thing the program does is to move the pointer over just once
to start from a fresh cell. Easy! Notice that the memory slots are all filling
up with 33&#39;s as well. やった！</p>
<p>But we have two more symbols, and they are the really good ones:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-title">[</span>   <span class="hljs-comment">if the value of current cell is zero skip to the matching bracket without executing the code</span>
<span class="hljs-title">]</span>   <span class="hljs-comment">if the value of the current cell is NOT zero go back to the opening bracket and execute the code again</span>
</code></pre>
<p>OMG! LOORPS!</p>
<p>The simplest loop in brainfuck is this one:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-title">[</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-title">]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This code decreases the value of the current cell until it is zero. If you just
ran this code and nothing else, it wouldn&#39;t do anything because the cell is
initialized at 0, thereby making the program skip the internal parts of the
bracket. But if we run this code:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-literal">+++++</span> <span class="hljs-title">[</span><span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-title">]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Well, it still <em>looks</em> like it does nothing, but really it increments
the value to 5 and then decrements it to zero.</p>
<p>Walk through it:</p>

<pre><code>Increase value of cell to 5
Value of cell is 5 so run the code.
Decrease to 4
Value is not zero so rerun the code
Decrease to 3
Value is not zero so rerun the code
Decrease to 2...
</code></pre>
<p>You get the idea. The loop will run until the value of the cell is zero and
then terminate- leaving the final value of everything at zero, leaving no
trace.</p>
<p>So in addition to starting each iteration of the program by moving to a &quot;clean&quot;
cell, you could also decrement the current cell back to zero (from wherever it
might have ended up) by inserting that simple loop before anything else.</p>
<p><a href="http://replit.com/K9B/2" target="_blank">Like this!</a></p>
<p>That&#39;s what the 8 symbols do. That&#39;s it!!! THAT&#39;S ALL IT IS!! But in theory,
you can write anything in brainfuck, any kind of program you can possibly write
in anything else could be realized. Of course, <a href="a
href=&quot;http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=20967&quot;">a
href=&quot;http://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=20967&quot;</a>CAN doesn&#39;t mean
SHOULD</a>, and writing an OS in brainfuck, while an immensely challenging and
interesting and curios problem, I&#39;m sure, has been likened to trying to build a
car by bolting parts onto a skateboard.</p>
<p>One more thing about loops.</p>
<p>You can use a helper cell to iterate a loop a specified number of times.
Consider this:</p>

<pre><code class="lang-brainfuck"><span class="hljs-literal">+++++</span> <span class="hljs-literal">+++++</span> <span class="hljs-title">[</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-literal">+++++</span> <span class="hljs-literal">+++++</span> &lt; <span class="hljs-literal">-</span><span class="hljs-title">]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This loads the first cell (our counter) to 10, then when the loop starts it
moves over to cell two to increment 10 times, before moving back to cell one to
decrement once. Just like before, it runs the code until the cell reaches zero-
but the code within the brackets is affecting the second cell.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s brainfuck. Sort of. This is really basic, but that&#39;s how it works.
You can write brainfuck code to run if/then statements and if/else statements
and all kinds of things.</p>
<p>Oh and PS: some interpreters use &quot;#&quot; as a debugging breakpoint. Whenever the
interpreter encounters it, it halts and waits for a signal to continue.</p>
