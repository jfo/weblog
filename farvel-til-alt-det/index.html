<p>September update: After a short but intense job hunt, I&#39;m happy to say I&#39;ll be starting
work with <a href="https://peakon.com/">Peakon</a> at their <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffowler/status/902596623271854081">beautiful office in Copenhagen</a> in a few weeks!
Thanks to all who <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffowler/status/890057552796450816">shared and read this post</a>, it was a vast help to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After 9 years in New York, I am leaving for good on August 1st, when I&#39;ll be
moving to Copenhagen with my wife and cat.</p>
<p>I came here with what were in retrospect some pretty vague ideas about what I
wanted to do, and I did some of that, and I did a bunch of other things I could
have never predicted. One of those things was &quot;become a computer programmer,&quot;
the decision to do so I maintain to be one of the most personally positively
impactful ones I have ever made and likely ever will make in my life. I have
limitless thanks for the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>,
<a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> and the many colleagues at both who helped to
make that transition not only possible but also totally joyful.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be looking for engineering work in the coming weeks and months. I&#39;m hoping
to find a job somewhere that is...</p>

<ul>
<li>small enough for me to have a big impact on but big enough to offer a measure
of stability<sup>1</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>...and that is...</p>

<ul>
<li>working on something familiar enough for me have an immediate impact at a
senior level but also on something that I could learn a lot from.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am open to working remotely if it&#39;s the right situation, but I think I would
probably be happier, more productive, and benefit more from working IRL in
Copenhagen right now.</p>
<p>At Etsy I primarily worked as a product engineer on <a href="https://www.etsy.com/manufacturing">Etsy
Manufacturing</a>, a matchmaking service
intended to connect makers with manufacturers who have the tools and knowledge
to help them scale up their businesses in a sustainable and transparent way.
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/14/business/etsy-welcomes-manufacturers-to-artisanal-fold.html">Here&#39;s a New York Times
article</a>
that was written about it when we initially launched.</p>
<p>While there, I split pretty evenly between the front and back ends. Sometimes I
describe this as &quot;full stack&quot; but I always add airquotes and equivocate on what
exactly I mean by that, since it&#39;s kind of a loaded and yet weirdly inspecific
term. I also had many opportunities to be exposed to a lot of other tools and
stacks and types of work, from data analytics and A/B testing to infrastructure
and operations.  Ask me about any of those things!</p>
<p>You can find many examples of my personal projects, communication and pedagogical styles, and
thought process on this blog. I think my favorites right now are <a href="/the-mandelwat-set/">The Mandelwat
Set</a>, which was republished in
<a href="https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-mandelwat-set-c3037204bf83">DailyJS</a>, the <a href="/sild-is-a-lisp-dialect/">Sild
series</a>, for which I wrote about 80,000 words on implementing an
interpreted lisp from scratch, and <a href="/how-react-do/">How React Do?</a>, which is my
attempt to figure out React from something resembling first-ish principles.</p>
<p><a href="/jeff_fowler_resume.pdf">Here&#39;s my resume</a>. Please note that I&#39;ve included
many hyperlinks in the PDF.</p>
<p>I like to work on interesting products that people use, and I love to both
learn and teach. If you know anyone in Copenhagen who I should talk to, <a href="mailto:jeffowler@gmail.com">please
let me know</a>! I&#39;ll also be at the <a href="https://summit.polymer-project.org/">Polymer
Summit</a> on August 22-23 and available to
talk then.</p>

probably way, way less stable than yours for most values of</em> <code>$you</code>. <em>What I really
