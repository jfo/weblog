<p>Well, Mara, they&#39;re mine, from a series I did last year futzing with old
polaroids. If I had the inclination I would say &quot;distressing expired
filmstock.&quot;</p>
<p>That was last year around this time, or a little later, in a burst of
uncharacteristically fretless output, that I&#39;d like to get to more often, pun
intended and I mean both ways this is a poorly written sentence.</p>
<p>Mostly I pressed the chemicals around in there using a wacom stylus and a flat
edge on a salt shaker. I&#39;ve always been rotten at drawing, but this was mostly
abstract enough for me to do it. I really loved the effect so I made about 60
of them, although the vast majority are, shall we say, aesthetically inferior
<em>ahemcrapahem</em>... but enough turned out to make it worth the time.</p>
<p>There is also something rattling around in my brain about being open to
inspiration from unconventional media, like when my microwave hums a closed
position major seventh chord, which is really weird cause it only does that
when I put vegetarian gyoza in there... go figure...</p>
<p>I finished a nine panel one that the title bar is taken from first:</p>

<p>And then made I think 5 or 6 to mail to some folks, but I don&#39;t remember who
got what, so maybe let me know in the comments.</p>
<p>Also, best of luck with your own V-I, we&#39;re all in this together.</p>
