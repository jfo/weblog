        <h1 class="title-thing">Sild is a lisp dialect</h1>
        <sub>Jun 05, 2016</sub>
        <p></p>
        <div><p>Today, I&#39;m releasing <a href="https://github.com/urthbound/sild"><strong>Sild</strong></a>, a tiny
little intepreted lisp that I wrote in C.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been interested in trying to learn about language design and
implementation for a while now. I&#39;ve also been interested in Lisp as a concept,
and I had <em>also</em> been wanting to learn C so that I could start wrapping my head
around systems programming. This project brought all of those objectives
together in a really natural way!</p>
<p>Sild is not conformant to any existing spec. It&#39;s not <em>really</em> a Scheme and it
is <em>definitely</em> not a version of Common Lisp. It is simply my attempt to build a
minimal lispy language in a semi-vacuum from first principles.</p>
<p>Though I&#39;m proud of the final result, that&#39;s not what I&#39;m <em>most</em> excited about
sharing. I also wrote blog posts as I went along. A <em>lot</em> of them. Just about
40,000 words&#39; worth! I&#39;m going to post them here in the coming weeks. It&#39;s my
hope that other people might be able to learn some of the things I learned!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to write those posts so that they will be understandable to someone
who can program in some language, and who maybe knows a <em>little</em> about C, and maybe
knows a <em>little</em> about lisp.</p>
<p>I am open to suggestions and criticisms. The posts might seem like they are
written from a position of authority, but do not be fooled. I was figuring
everything out as I went along, then writing them down just after I had figured
them out, and I most certainly did not nail everything! I am very interested to
hear where what I tried to do diverged from historical attempts, or where I
reinvented some wheel or another.</p>
<hr>

<p>I was inspired to try this project by a variety of things.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mary Rose Cook&#39;s <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/21-little-lisp-interpreter"><em>Little Lisp Interpreter</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>At some point during a long flight I tried coding most of this post in Ruby. I don&#39;t
remember what I did with that repo, and I don&#39;t think it even really worked all
the way, but it gave me the idea that a lisp might be a lot easier to
implement than I thought.</p>

<ul>
<li>Paul Graham&#39;s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/rootsoflisp.html"><em>The Roots of Lisp</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very sticky essay. Graham&#39;s proceduralness possesses a certain kind
of clarity that left me with the impression that it might be worth trying to
write the simple lisp he describes, and indeed that&#39;s pretty much what I ended
up with. Sild, as it is right now, has no types (like strings or numbers), and
has no I/O save a basic <code>display</code> that prints to <code>stdout</code>. It has no real
standard library to speak of, either, but it <em>does</em> have the basic operations
that Graham describes as necessary to implement <code>eval</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Daniel Holden&#39;s <a href="http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/"><em>Build Your Own Lisp</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Google &quot;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=build+your+own+lisp&amp;oq=build+your+own+lisp&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2.2691j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">build your own
lisp</a>&quot;,
and you&#39;ll get an entire first page of results referencing this site. I <a href="https://github.com/urthbound/buildyourownlisp">gave
it a good go</a>, making it to
chapter 9 or so, and I have to say that it is incredibly well thought out and
well expressed and I totally learned a lot from it! But somewhere along the way I started
feeling like I was just typing things in until they worked without really
understanding why, which is my personal canary in the coal mine for impending
this-isn&#39;t-working-for-me-anymore-ness. Then I read the URL and realized what
appealed to me so much about the site is the <em>your</em> in &quot;build your own lisp&quot;, so
I stopped working through the tutorial and decided to try that for real! From
there, I circled back to the Paul Graham essay and used it as a guide.</p>
<hr>

<p>There were a variety of other things I ran across while writing this language
that I read parts of, with the intention of revisiting them with a more context
after I was done with the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>John McCarthy&#39;s original 1960 paper <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html"><em>Recursive Functions of Symbolic
Expressions and Their Computation by Machine (Part
I)</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I had &quot;read&quot; this a few times, but always with the feeling I wasn&#39;t really
getting it. Implementing what amounts to the lisp described in this paper
(via the Paul Graham essay), has made this seminal work a lot easier to
comprehend!</p>

<ul>
<li>Sussman and Abelson&#39;s <a href="http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/ai-lab-pubs/AIM-453.pdf"><em>The Art of the Interpreter</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>I consulted this a few times when I ran into specific questions, but again, I
didn&#39;t really grok it until after I had finished the whole thing. The finer
points of closures and mutability and garbage collection were all lost on me
until I banged my own head against them all for a while. The first time I read
this paper it was a &quot;I know these words&quot; sort of situation. Now, it&#39;s more of a
&quot;YES OMG YES SO TRUE&quot; kind of deal.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sussman and Abelson&#39;s <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I had read a lot of this before, and had gotten real value out of it. But
now when I go back, it just reads a lot richer and more nuanced, and I find
myself considering intricacies that simply wouldn&#39;t have occured to me before.</p>
<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>
<p>Big thanks to <a href="https://github.com/andrewrk">Andrew Kelley</a>, whose brilliant
code reviews levelled up my C on multiple occasions. Also to <a href="https://github.com/darius">Darius
Bacon</a>, whose feedback had a fantastic twinge of &quot;I
have trod where you tread&quot; that helped me appreciate all the things I must have
missed. I look forward to finding them out in more detail!</p>
<p>Also to <a href="http://thewebivore.com/">Pam Selle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nickdrozd">Nick
Drozd</a> for reading early posts, and <a href="https://github.com/stijlist">Bert
Muthalany</a> for his enthusiasm.</p>
<hr>

<p>Working on this language was immensely rewarding, and I learned an enormous
amount from it. While I intend to work on it more, adding some of the TODO&#39;s
in the README, and hope to end up with a useful scripting language all to
myself, the original motivation of the project has been satisfied. I hope you
find it as interesting as I did!</p>
